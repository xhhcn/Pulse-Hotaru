# Stage 2: Build frontend on the NATIVE build platform.
#
# The frontend output is a static HTML/JS/CSS bundle — completely
# architecture-independent — so we never need to build it under the
# target platform. Omitting `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` causes buildx
# to run this stage under QEMU emulation when building linux/arm64 on
# an amd64 runner, and `npm ci` (via its native `node-gyp` / V8
# bootstrap code) crashes with "qemu: uncaught target signal 4
# (Illegal instruction) - core dumped". Pinning to the BUILD platform
# avoids emulation entirely and makes arm64 builds as fast as amd64.
