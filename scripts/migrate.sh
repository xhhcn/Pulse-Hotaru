# pulse-migrate -- one-shot migration from an old Pulse server to this host.
#
# Run this on the NEW server, after you've installed Pulse on it (via
# install-pulse-server.sh for the standalone binary, or `docker compose
# up -d` for Docker). It:
#
#   1. Logs in to the OLD server with the admin password you supply
#      (or a token, if you have one).
#   2. Pulls a consistent hot-snapshot of the OLD server's database
#      via GET /api/admin/backup — no downtime on the old server.
#   3. Verifies the snapshot (size + bbolt magic number) to catch a
#      bad transfer before anything destructive runs.
#   4. Stops the local Pulse process (auto-detects docker vs
#      systemd), preserves the existing metrics.db as
#      metrics.db.pre-restore-<utc> so rollback is one command,
#      swaps the snapshot in, and starts the service again.
#   5. Polls /healthz until the new instance is live.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/migrate.sh --from http://OLD_HOST:8008
#   sudo ./scripts/migrate.sh --from http://OLD_HOST:8008 --password 'YourPW'
#   sudo ./scripts/migrate.sh --from http://OLD_HOST:8008 --token  'TOKEN'
#   sudo ./scripts/migrate.sh --from http://OLD_HOST:8008 --mode systemd -y
#   sudo ./scripts/migrate.sh --from http://OLD_HOST:8008 --keep-backup snapshot.db
#
# Flags (all optional unless noted):
#   --from URL          old server base URL (required)
#   --password PW       admin password of the old server (prompted if omitted)
#   --token  TOK        admin token of the old server (skips login step)
#   --mode   MODE       docker | systemd | auto (default: auto)
#   --compose-dir DIR   docker-compose dir for the NEW host (default: cwd)
#   --data-dir    DIR   override target metrics.db directory
#   --port   PORT       health-check port on the NEW host (default: 8008)
#   --service NAME      systemd unit name (default: pulse-server)
#   --install-dir DIR   standalone install dir (default: /opt/pulse)
#   --keep-backup FILE  keep the downloaded snapshot at this path
#                       (default: delete after successful restore)
#   -y, --yes           non-interactive, skip the confirmation prompt
#   -h, --help          show this help
